        <p>&ldquo;Christmas won&rsquo;t be Christmas without any presents,&rdquo; grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dreadful to be poor!&rdquo; sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,&rdquo; added little Amy, with an injured sniff.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got Father and Mother, and each other,&rdquo; said Beth contentedly from her corner.</p>

        <p>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;perhaps never,&rdquo; but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was.</p>

        <p>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, &ldquo;You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can&rsquo;t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.</p>

      <p>"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.</p>

      <p>"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.</p>

      <p>"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly.</p>

      <p>"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.</p>

      <p>"I know I doâ€”teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone again.</p>

      <p>"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out the window or cry?"</p>
