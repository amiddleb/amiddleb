            <p>They certainly have used up a lot of ink lately—partly inspired by Mother Jones&rsquo;s reporting over the past year. California&rsquo;s drought-stricken Central Valley churns out 80 percent of the globe&rsquo;s almonds, and since each nut takes a gallon of water to produce, they account for close to 10 percent of the state&rsquo;s annual agricultural water use—or more than what the entire population of Los Angeles and San Francisco use in a year. As Grist&rsquo;s Nathanael Johnson put it, almonds have become a scapegoat of sorts—&ldquo;the poster-nut for human wastefulness in California&rsquo;s drought.&rdquo; Or, as Alissa Walker put it in Gizmodo, &ldquo;You know, ALMONDS, THE DEVIL&rsquo;S NUT.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not surprising that the almond backlash has inspired a backlash of its own. California agriculture is vast and complex, and its water woes can&rsquo;t hang entirely on any one commodity, not even one as charismatic as the devil&rsquo;s nut almond. And as many have pointed out, almonds have a lot going for them—they&rsquo;re nutritious, they taste good, and they&rsquo;re hugely profitable for California. In 2014, almonds brought in a whopping $11 billion to the state&rsquo;s economy. Plus, other foods—namely, animal products—use a whole lot more water per ounce than almonds.</p>

            <p>So almonds must be worth all the water they require, right? Not so fast. Before you jump to any conclusions, consider the following five facts:</p>

            <p>Most of our almonds end up overseas. Almonds are the second-thirstiest crop in California—behind alfalfa, a superfood of sorts for cows that sucks up 15 percent of the state&rsquo;s irrigation water. Gizmodo&rsquo;s Walker—along with many others—wants to shift the focus from almonds to the ubiquitous feed crop, wondering, &ldquo;Why are we using more and more of our water to grow hay?&rdquo; Especially since alfalfa is a relatively low-value crop—about a quarter of the per acre value of almonds—and about a fifth of it is exported.</p>

            <p>It should be noted, though, that we export far more almonds than alfalfa: About two-thirds of California&rsquo;s almond and pistachio crops are sent overseas—a de facto export of California&rsquo;s overtapped water resources.</p>
